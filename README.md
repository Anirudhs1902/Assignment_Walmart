The above code is to fetch list of countries in JSON format from the given URL. The code is robust following MVVM architectural pattern and supports device orientation. Edge cases and error handling is implemented in the code to prevent the app from crashes.I added null checks to check whether data is null when pulling from URL. Retrofit API error handling is done in detail to know the cause of error. Implemented a retry button to fetch the data after resolving error. Finally I used DiffUtil only to update the changed items in list.
